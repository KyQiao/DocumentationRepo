  abstract = {Local structure characterization with the bond-orientational order parameters q4, q6, … introduced by Steinhardt et al. [Phys. Rev. B 28, 784 (1983) https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.784.] has become a standard tool in condensed matter physics, with applications including glass, jamming, melting or crystallization transitions, and cluster formation. Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics q′lql′{$<$}math overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}msubsup{$><$}mi{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi{$>$}l{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>$}′{$<$}/mo{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/math{$>$}.

  abstract = {Bond-orientational order in molecular-dynamics simulations of supercooled liquids and in models of metallic glasses is studied. Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems. A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10\% below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative "amorphon" cluster models of glass structure.},
